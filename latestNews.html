<p><b> MEN'S TENNIS SENIOR TRIO WILL SERVE AS TRINITY CAPTAINS IN 2010-11</b>
<br>Hartford, Conn. - The Trinity College men’s tennis program is eager to continue its annual success with six returning veterans, four returning starters, and another solid recruiting class.  The Bantams will feel the loss of two-time All-American Spencer Feldman to graduation, but senior tri-captain and 2009-10 Team MVP Richard Bonfiglio (Bronxville, N.Y.) and All-American doubles junior Anson McCook (Miami, Fla.) head an impressive group eager to make their own mark in the NESCAC and among the nation’s best teams.  Trinity opens the 2010-11 fall season in Sept. 10-12 at the Middlebury College Invitational. Bonfiglio finished the 2009-10 season with a 16-4 singles record and a 13-7 doubles mark, playing at the No. 3 position in the Trinity singles lineup.  McCook was an All-American last season and finished as the No. 10-ranked pair in the country in doubles with Feldman and boasted a 17-7 mark as the No. 2 singles player for the Bantams.  Seniors David Dessau (New York, N.Y.), 13-8 in his singles career, and D.J. Patrick (Atlanta, Ga.), 9-5, in his singles career, join Bonfiglio as 2010-11 tri-captains, while junior Charles McConnell (New York, N.Y.)has been an All-NESCAC doubles player and earned experience in the varsity singles lineup last season.  Junior Dill Ayres (Laurel Hollow, N.Y.) and sophomore Juqal Marfatia (Surat, India) are the other frontrunners that will battle a solid group of newcomers for several available spots in the lineup.
