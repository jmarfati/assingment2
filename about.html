<p><b>THE DESIGN OF MY WEBPAGE </b></p>
<p>I have created a webpage for the trinity Mens Tennis Program. The index.html is the home page which has links to all the other six pages. The six pages are 1. Latest news:- This gives the user the information about the latest news in the program as in the
 results of the tournaments etc. 2. Roster:- This gives the user information about all the players in the team with a team picture on the top. 3. Coaches:- This provides information about the Head coach and the asistant coach of the team. 4. Sign up:- This
 lets the user sign up for the website. It asks the user a few questions. 5. Login:- This page lets the user login in their accounts whne the enter their username and the password. 6. About the program:- This gives a bit of information about the teams history.

<p>These are a few very simple webpages that has a few images, tables, forms etc. Creating this pages helped me understand HTML better and also helped me use a few basic HTML applications.
