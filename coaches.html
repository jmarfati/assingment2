<br>
<br>
<p>Entering his 15th year, Head Coach Paul Assaiante enjoyed another outstanding season as head coach of the Bantam men’s tennis team.  In the fall, Assaiante guided the squad to a 13-6 dual match record and earned a fourth straight bid to the six-team, NESCAC Championship Tournament.  The team finished the season ranked No. 5 in the ITA Division III Northeast Regional Poll and No. 17 in the ITA Division III National Poll, and made their first NESCAC semifinals appearance.  The 2008 NESCAC and the Northeast Regional Coach of the Year, Assaiante has compiled a 154-63 record as tennis coach in 14 seasons at the helm.</P>

<p>Assaiante has also coached the Trinity men’s squash squad for the past 16 seasons, notching a 260-10 record with 11 consecutive collegiate national championship titles including last season. Assaiante has also been head coach of the World team Tennis’ Hartford Fox Force.</p>

<br>
<p>Besides his coaching duties, Assaiante has served as the director of athletic development at Trinity for six years, spearheading the College’s effort to upgrade its athletic facilities. In a short time, Assaiante has played a pivotal role in the fund-raising efforts, which have already produced two new synthetic outdoor fields, the nation’s premier squash facility, a new boathouse, and a community ice skating center for the College. In all, more than $7 million has been raised with ongoing projects that include new baseball and softball diamonds and a new field house.</P>

<p>From 1999-2003, Assaiante coached both the United States Squash Team, which competed in the Pan American Games, and the USA Men’s Team, which played in the World Championships. Twice named the United States Olympic Committee Coach of the Year, Assaiante was named one of Connecticut’s top sports coaches of the 20th century by The Hartford Courant, and recently earned an award from the Hartford Business Bureau for his outstanding contribution to sports in the city.</p>

<p>Assaiante is a 1974 graduate of Springfield College and holds a master’s degree from Long Island University. His coaching experience includes stints at the United States Military Academy and Williams College. He was also a squash professional at the world-famous Princeton Club of New York, and director of racquet sports at the Baltimore Country Club, the Apawamis Club in Rye, N.Y., and the Bellevue Athletic Club in Seattle, Wash.</p>

<p>Assaiante’s professional athletic career was nothing short of spectacular.  He was one-half of the U.S. national doubles championship duo in 1994 and captured the USSRA 50-and-over men’s squash title this past March.  Assaiante is an author of Championship Tennis by the Experts: How to Play Championship Tennis, with Vic Braden (Human Kinetics Publishers, June 1981) and the upcoming book, Run to the Roar: Coaching to Overcome Fear with James Zug (Portfolio Hardcover) scheduled for release later this fall.</P>

<p>Michael Smith, holder of a United States Soccer Federation "B" license and National Soccer Coaches Association of America advanced national diploma, is entering his 13th season overall and 10th as full-time head coach of the women's soccer program at Trinity.
